Original source of this guidance see https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview

You may create cross-platform applications without ever leaving Windows by installing a full Ubuntu terminal environment on your Windows computer in a matter of minutes with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
We'll walk you through setting up Ubuntu on WSL in this guide. You can use these instructions with Windows 10 or Windows 11.

1) Type Windows PowerShell into the Windows search bar. From there, select Run as administrator.
2) At the command prompt type:
   wsl --install
3) And then wait for the process to complete. You will now need to restart your computer for WSL to be properly active.
